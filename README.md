# Matious_E_News_Front_End
A front end application made using react native and expo.

# React Native (front end ) :
The third part of the project and final one requires having a front end application in order to use and display the endpoints given by the back end server in a user freindly manner.
The front end application was developped in react native means its cross plateform and can run on both ios and android.

#### Setting up the environment :
##### Seeting up expo :  
In order to build the react native app we used expo as opposed to standard react native cli since expo gives some cool advantages like easy acess to some apis and native features.
expo documentation and more on how to get started can be found here : [expo documentation] (https://docs.expo.io/)
To set up expo (you should have nodejs and npm installed !) we use the following commands 
```bash
npm install expo-cli --global
```
The and after navigating to the project directory we run the following command to install the diffrent npm packages : 
```bash
npm install
```
finally and to run the react native project and see the app ( assuing you have an android / ios simulator installed on your machine ) we use the following command : 
```bash
expo start --android or expo start --ios 
```
This will run the application on the android simulator ( or on your own phone if you download the expo app and just scan the QR code)
